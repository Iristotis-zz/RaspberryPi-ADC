# RaspberryPi-ADC
Get the MCP3008 working on a Raspberry Pi.

Using the Adafruit libraries for the MCP3008, this is a simple script for getting everything needed to get a MCP3008 to function installed. This also gives a few example programs & code snippets.

This will have a few things from my other TMP36 project as the TMP uses the MCP3008.
